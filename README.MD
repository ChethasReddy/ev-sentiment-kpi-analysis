# 🔋 NLP-Driven Analysis of Electric Vehicle Reviews and Public Sentiment

This project explores public sentiment and key performance indicators (KPIs) surrounding Electric Vehicles (EVs) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and global market data.

We combine:

- **User review data** (India-focused)
- **Global EV sales and adoption data**
- **Macro trends from IEA's EV Data Explorer**

## 🚀 Objectives

- Analyze and visualize sentiment trends across EV models
- Identify KPIs that users care about most (e.g., battery, charging, comfort)
- Compare sentiment scores to market performance globally
